## Project Overview.
Multi-objective optimization is crucial across various fields as it enables balancing conflicting goals, such as performance versus cost in engineering or profit versus impact in economics. This approach leads to more comprehensive and effective solutions, better suited to complex real-world challenges.


This project aimed to enhance ensmallen's capabilities in multi objective optimization by implementing optimizers such as AGE-MOEA and NSGA-3 and various problems from the MAF Benchmark test suite.
